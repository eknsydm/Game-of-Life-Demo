# Game of Life Demo

Welcome to the **Game of Life Demo** repository! This project implements Conway's Game of Life in C. It's a simulation of cellular automata, a classic example of how complex patterns and behaviors can emerge from simple rules.

## Conway's Game of Life Rules

1. **Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.**
2. **Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.**
3. **Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.**
4. **Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.**
